Beastie's Fortress
==================

About
-----

Beastie's Fortress is an online book dedicated to advanced `FreeBSD`_ server
administration concepts. It is built on a decade of tutorials, guides and FAQ
entries contributed by its authors. Once completed, it will cover these topics:

* headless installation procedures
* securing and tuning of the network stack
* advanced jail management for mass hosting
* custom package repositories
* maintenance strategies and procedures


Roadmap
-------

Beastie's Fortress is still work in progress at a very early stage. If you
are curious about the topics we are currently working on, please have a look
at our `Huboard`_, where we try keeping track of ongoing work.


Contact & Support
-----------------

Beastie's Fortress is written and maintained by the `RootForum.org`_ team.
For a general contact, it's easiest opening a topic within the `forum`_ - and
though most content over there is in German, don't be shy posting in English -
we'll understand you either way :-)

Should you need support on a specific topic, or if you'd like to report a bug,
please use the `project's tracker`_ at GitHub - this helps us keeping track
on things and enhances your chances for a satisfactory solution to your problem.


Credits
-------

Beastie's Fortress development heavily relies on experiences gathered among the
years running the `RootForum.org`_ community, spent with discussing and sharing
thoughts on the management of (internet) servers among the community. Therefore,
a big thank you goes to all active contributors of this wonderful community.

A special thanks goes to Joe User, our tireless chief admin, who also whipped
up some great FreeBSD `HowTos`_, which served as a huge source of inspiration
for this project.
