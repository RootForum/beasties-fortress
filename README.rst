Beastie's Fortress
==================

About
-----

Beastie's Fortress is a collection of useful utilities bundled within one
tool set. It is intended to support setup, maintenance and management of
FreeBSD servers that are set up in accordance with the procedures and policies
described in the corresponding documentation.

Its main focus is on managing systems with a large number of service jails,
supporting most standard maintenance tasks such as:

* Creating and removing service jails
* Updating or upgrading the FreeBSD base of any service jail
* Updating packages installed within a service jail


Contact & Support
-----------------

Beastie's Fortress is developed and maintained by the `RootForum.org`_ team.
For a general contact, it's easiest opening a topic within the `forum`_ - and 
though most content over there is in German, don't be shy posting in English - 
we'll understand you either way :-)

Should you need support on a specific topic, or if you'd like to report a bug,
please use the `project's tracker`_ at GitHub - this helps us keeping track
on things and enhances your chances for a satisfactory solution to your problem.



Credits
-------

Beastie's Fortress development heavily relies on experiences gathered among the
years running the `RootForum.org`_ community, spent with discussing and sharing
thoughts on the management of (internet) servers among the community. Therefore,
a big thank you goes to all active contributors of this wonderful community.

A special thanks goes to Joe User, our tireless chief admin, who also whipped
up some great FreeBSD `HowTos`_, which served as a huge source of inspiration
for this project.
